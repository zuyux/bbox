# 🟧 BBOX — The Open Bitcoin App Store

**BBOX** is a decentralized app directory and funding layer for Bitcoin and its Layer-2 ecosystems (Stacks, Lightning, Runes, etc.).  
It helps users discover, evaluate, and fund open-source Bitcoin applications through transparent milestones and smart contracts.

---

## 🚀 Vision

BBOX aims to become the **App Store of the Bitcoin economy** — permissionless, open-source, and community-governed.

- Curate and verify apps built on Bitcoin L1 + L2 networks.  
- Enable milestone-based funding and bounties in BTC, STX, or other Bitcoin-anchored assets.  
- Provide a unified UX for builders, users, and DAOs to coordinate development transparently.  
- Support local Bitcoin communities and hackathons through **BBOX Grants**.
